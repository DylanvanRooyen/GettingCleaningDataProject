# GettingCleaningDataProject
In this project I downloaded the given data, Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracted the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each of the measurements. Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names. Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The functions are written in run_analysis.R.
